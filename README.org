* Working With This Fork
** Building
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
npm i
make
#+END_SRC
** Testing
From this project's root directory:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
make
cp ./packages/babel-register/lib/* $GG_HOME/gg-web/node_modules/packages/babel-register/lib
cp ./packages/babel-register/lib/* $GG_HOME/gg-web/admin/node_modules/packages/babel-register/lib
#+END_SRC
Then run grunt server in gg-web and see if it works

we use babel differently locally and in deployed environments so make sure you can successfully deploy both web and admin to feature branches/staging before going to prod
